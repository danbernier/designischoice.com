Pecha Kucha is coming to New Haven (well, Hamden, really) on Wednesday, May 18, 7 PM.

I'll be there to tell the story of the [pool noodle animals project](/projects/pool-noodle-animals/). I'll do my best to make it a good story, but even if I totally fail, the other presenters will make up for it. And it's at [The Outer Space](http://www.theouterspace.net/), so you can enjoy a drink.
