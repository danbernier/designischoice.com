After talking about John Brunner with my friend [Shawn Crahan](https://plus.google.com/108723091794785516898), I saw that "Stand on Zanzibar" was [reprinted in August 2011](http://www.amazon.com/Stand-Zanzibar-John-Brunner/dp/0765326787), with a very [WordCram](http://wordcram.org)-y cover:

Book covers was always one of the things people talked about using WordCram for, so I thought I'd try making a fake Borges cover. I think they came out well enough to prove out the idea. I'm not sold on the gradient - I like how the solid orange one came out. But I like the idea of having random words (straight out of the Library of Babel) on the cover.

The font I used was Bebas Neue, which, it seems, you can never go wrong with.
