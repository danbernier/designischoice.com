I found [this TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_antonsen_math_is_the_hidden_secret_to_understanding_the_world/) today, where [Roger Antonsen](http://rantonse.no/en) says that, to understand something, you have to look at it from different perspectives. That sounds psychological or sociological, or even (especially lately) political, but it's actually a math talk. To me, it described the process of making generative art, but from a very different perspective.

## Patterns, and Language to Describe Them

His "day-to-day definition of math" reminds me of the process I go through when working on a new gen-art piece, or exploring a programming abstraction. He says math is about:

* Finding patterns: "a connection, a structure, some regularity, some rules that govern what we see."
* Representing those patterns with a language. "We make up language if we don't have it, and in mathematics, this is essential." 
* Making assumptions, and playing around with them to see what happens.
* "Doing cool stuff. Mathematics enables us to do so many things."

When I make a Processing sketch, I'm usually looking for interesting patterns or regularities that can be generated by algorithm. The algorithm becomes a langauge to describe and represent the patterns - not just one image, but the set of all images the algorithm can generate. Since I'm often making up the algorithm as I go, I'm making up that language. As I build and refine the algorithm, "playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens" is a how I look for more-interesting variants to the main idea.

## Equations as Metaphor

He goes on to look at the number 4/3 from several perspectives: in decimal (1.33333...), in binary (1.010101010...), in base 3 (1.1), as a 4x3 rectangle, as the sides of a 3-4-5 right triangle, as the aspect ratio of old computer screens and TVs, as generating a [Lissajous curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve), as the [just interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation) of [a perfect fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fourth), and as producing a counter-point rhythm when every fourth 16th note is played, and every third 16th note is played on top of it.

This translation of an idea into a different form is also a good way to explore generative art. Often, I'll explore an idea, and reach a plateau where it turns boring, and it only really gets interesting once I've put it into some different context.

Small surprise that [his twitter feed is recently featuring work made with Processing](https://twitter.com/rantonse/status/805213796654575616).
