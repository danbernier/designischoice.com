<p>I often get absorbed by the tool-building phase of an art project, and
sometimes the tool becomes its own project.</p>

<p>Often while working on a Processing sketch, I’ll want to control some aspect of
it more directly, to explore or test a range of variability. It’s usually easy
enough to do this with a mouse or trackpad by mapping <code>mouseX</code> and <code>mouseY</code> to
control the values I want to manipulate, but sometimes I want more control. And
for showing projects in front of an audience, control becomes critical.
<a href="https://sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/">controlP5</a> is a Processing library
meant for this, but it ties you to manipulating sliders and dials with your
mouse.</p>

<p>When I first saw the korg nanoKONTROL2, it seemed like a better approach.  I
connected it to my laptop and started a Processing sketch to read its values,
using <a href="http://www.smallbutdigital.com/projects/themidibus/">The MidiBus</a> as an
example-slash-troubleshooting instrument, and quickly realized that raw MIDI
would get me about forty percent of what I wanted: the sliders and dials worked
right out of the box, but that was it. The buttons didn’t quite work - I’ve
forgotten most of the details, but I remember that their mode (press-to-toggle,
or press-and-hold) didn’t work. I had to dive into the KONTROL2’s
system-extension messages, and its “scene”: the onboard configuration, and all
the proprietary messages that configure it. And anyway, tracking all the
sliders and dials in a sketch was going to be tedious to organize each time; I
found myself wanting to instantiate some kind of <code>Kontrol2</code> class and have an
object for the device that organized all that stuff for me.</p>

<p>Here’s an example sketch that shows it in use. The <code>k2</code> object is a <code>Kontrol2</code>
instance. You just instantiate it, and it finds the device from the available
MIDI connections. It has methods to configure it (e.g. <code>recordMode</code>), and
methods to read its current values (e.g. <code>slider(2)</code> for the second slider).</p>

<pre><code>import korgnano.*;

Kontrol2 k2;
void setup() {
  k2 = new Kontrol2();

  // The buttons all default to Momentary mode - they're only "on" while you're
  // pressing them down. Let's set some to Toggle mode.
  k2.recordMode(3, ButtonMode.Toggle);
  k2.soloMode(8, ButtonMode.Toggle);
} 

void draw() {
  background(
    map(k2.slider(1), 0, 127, 0, 255),
    map(k2.slider(2), 0, 127, 0, 255),
    map(k2.dial(3), 0, 127, 0, 255));
  
  // If the eighth solo button ("S") is pressed, toggle between stroke &amp; fill.
  // Note: it's 1-based, not 0-based.
  if (k2.solo(8)) {
    stroke(255);
    noFill();
  }
  else {
    noStroke();
    fill(255);
  }
  
  // If the seventh mute button ("M") is pressed, draw a circle.
  if (k2.mute(7)) {
    ellipse(width/2, height/2, 50, 50);
  }
  
  // If the third record button ("R") is pressed, toggle RGB &amp; HSB.
  if (k2.record(3)) {
    colorMode(HSB);
  }
  else {
    colorMode(RGB);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The library is a simple, thin layer between your code and the device - it
doesn’t map values to your target range, it reflects the underlying MIDI
reality and reports values as integers from 0..127, per the MIDI spec.</p>

<h1 id="the-other-korg-nano-devices-pad-and-keys">The other Korg nano devices: PAD, and KEYS</h1>

<p>I also bought a nanoPAD and a nanoKEYS. The original plan was to write an
adapter for each of them, but the balance of forces didn’t work out the same in
these cases. The nanoKEYS is basically a piano, and plays MIDI notes; there’s
not much that an intermediary could contribute. It’s the same for the nanoPAD,
but even more so: my clearest idea for it would be to use it to trigger
different modes for a sketch (color blend? motion blur? kinds of randomness?
…color palettes?), but the MIDI part of that is trivial - the hard part is
building the modes and how they interact…and that’s just not about MIDI.</p>
