After talking about John Brunner with a friend, I saw that "Stand on Zanzibar"
was [reprinted in August
2011](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9663875-stand-on-zanzibar), with a
very [WordCram](https://github.com/danbernier/wordcram)-y cover:

Book covers was always one of the things people talked about using WordCram
for, so I thought I'd try making a fake Borges cover. I think they came out
well enough to prove out the idea. I'm not sold on the gradient - I like how
the solid orange one came out. But I like the idea of having random words
(straight out of the Library of Babel) on the cover.

The typeface I used was Bebas Neue, which, it seems, you can never go wrong
with.
