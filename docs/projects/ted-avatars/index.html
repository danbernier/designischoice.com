<p>This project reminds me of the beauty of organic shapes.</p>

<p>It often speaks to me about the importance of small differences.</p>

<p>While working at <a href="https://www.ted.com">TED</a>, I was part of a project to replace their default avatar,
a gray silhouette, with something better.</p>

<h1 id="goal">Goal</h1>

<p>You generate avatars so your site looks more interesting than a sea of gray
silhouettes, but people should still want to upload their photo.</p>

<p>Like any avatar, the images should be clear enough that you can easily tell
them apart, even at small sizes, and they should be stable - you can’t identify
a person from an abstract image that always changes.</p>

<p>The only datum we had for every TED profile was the timestamp of when the
person signed up. (You don’t have to provide a name when you sign up, and some
profiles created through other systems don’t have an email address.)</p>

<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>

<p>That last constraint was the first to inform the initial design: <a href="http://www.taralynnconnelly.com">Tara Lynn
Connelly</a> produced 24 proof-of-concept images
that combined the hour the account was created in TED’s logo typeface,
Helvetica, with an organic shape, and a red circle symbolizing the one TED
speakers stand on. The hour numbers ran from 1 through 12, and different colors
for the organic shape provided an AM and a PM variant.</p>

<p>When you can only have one of 24 avatars, it’s inevitable you’ll have the same
one as someone else.  On a page listing only 10 profiles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">the probability that
at least two of them have the same
avatar</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1 - (24/24 * 23/24 * 22/24 * … * 15/24)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That comes out to 89%. So the next step was to generate enough avatars that
you’d probably never find anyone with the same as you.</p>

<p>To ensure you always have the same avatar, there are two approaches: generate
images randomly and store them, or create a deterministic algorithm that
generates images from profile data. We chose the latter because it’s cheaper
and simpler, though it means any change to the algorithm would change
everyone’s avatars.</p>

<!--
    def birthday(pigeons, boxes)
      for_print = []
      parts = boxes.downto(boxes-(pigeons-1)).map { |n|
        for_print << "#{n}/#{boxes}"
        n / boxes.to_f
      }
      puts "1 - (#{for_print.join(' * ')})"

      1.0 - parts.reduce(:*)
    end
-->

<!--
TODO
One constraint we discovered only once we'd been in development for a while was
that the images should not change too gradually, second-to-second or
minute-to-minute, because ted.com/people would let you sort profiles by when
they were created, and since the creation date was the only input to the
algorithm, if the algorithm varied its output too little, that page would show
a bunch of avatars that had only minimal variation &em; it wasn't enough that
they be different, they had to be obviously different. 
-->

<h1 id="build">Build</h1>

<p>Tara asked her teammates <a href="https://redopop.com">Joe Bartlett</a> and me for help.</p>

<p>Since the primary target platform was ted.com, Joe suggested we generate SVGs,
producing a crisp image at any resolution and dimension, from a tiny file
that’s fast to download. A random example I just picked weighs only 1.37 KB.</p>

<p>This was a new approach for me: rather than expressing calculations in code, we
generated SVGs via text templates. Tara already grasped the kinds of variations
she wanted, and we were able to express that as a set of string interpolations
with some logic transforming the input date into colors, radii, opacities,
rotations, etc, as needed; the organic shapes and Helvetica number shapes were
stored in an array of path coordinates, and the input date also became an index
into it.</p>

<p>This made the SVG generation process and its code very legible (“how does this
number become that SVG?”), even if it obscured the logic of the generative
algorithm (“WHY does this number become that SVG?”).</p>

<h1 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h1>

<!--
TODO
<How do I tell this part of the story? ...DO I tell it?>
<Do I tell the SVG-to-PNG part of the story? The React part?>

<How about the color-change part? There's an interesting story there about
generative projects and apparent diversity. And it'd be cool to have the
code have a toggle for which color scheme> TODO
-->

<p>Shortly before the avatars were deployed to production, there was a shift in
design direction, and the color palette was changed to be more blue. Here, I’ve
included examples from the original palette out of sentimentality, and to
preserve that version somewhere, but you can see the final versions at
<a href="https://www.ted.com/people">ted.com/people</a>.</p>

<p>You can see a much broader range of avatars in the original colors at <a href="https://fun.redopop.com/avatars/">Joe’s
demo site</a>.</p>
