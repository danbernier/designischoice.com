The Marilyn is the first pool noodle project [Dan Gries](https://dangries.com) and I did together.

<!--
We were hanging our art for Re:Generate, a show exhibiting generative
artists from New Haven. One of us (I don't remember who) looked up at the cage
around the oldest running elevator in Connecticut, and said "that's like a
low-res pixel grid, we should do something with that."

Neither of us had done much with anything non-digital; all the work we were
exhibiting was on a screen or printed PDFs our algorithms had generated. We
thought pool noodles might be easy to find, and easy to shape, and hey, they
already come in colors.

We tried some experiments:

So, what should the image be? We thought a human face might be easiest to
recognize, and maybe a famous face at that, so we went with one of [Warhol's
portfolio Monroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe_portfolio):

<div class="big">
  {{ "marilyn.jpg" | thumb | img }}
</div>

We were surprised during the show to see people parse the image as an abstract:
some only recognized it as a picture when they saw it through their phone as they took a photo,
and saw it smaller:

<div class="big">
  {{ "scales.png" | thumb | img }}
</div>

(Some of them thought it was a photo of Queen Elizabeth, too.)

This made us realize
