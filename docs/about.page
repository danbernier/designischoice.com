Design is Choice is where Daniel Bernier collects his generative art projects.

Design is a process of choosing. Generative art is a process of processes:
write an algorithm, run it, consider its outputs, adjust it, and run it again;
repeat until enough of the outputs look good enough.

As it runs, the algorithm makes dozens or trillions of choices, based on its
inputs and the rules and steps that define it. As you shape the algorithm, you
make choices based on what the algorithm produces, how fast or efficiently it
runs, what data sources are available to feed it.

To choose is to design.
