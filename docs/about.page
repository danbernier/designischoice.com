Design is Choice is where Dan Bernier collects his generative art projects.

Design is a process of choosing. Generative art is a process of processes: a
human writes an algorithm, runs it, considers its outputs, adjusts it, and runs
it again, repeating this until enough of the outputs look good enough.

As it runs, an algorithm makes dozens of choices, or trillions. The algorithm
makes its choices based on its inputs and its structure, the rules and steps
that define it. As the generative artist shapes their algorithm, they make
their choices based on what the algorithm produces, how fast or efficiently it
runs, what data sources are available to feed it.

To choose is to design.
