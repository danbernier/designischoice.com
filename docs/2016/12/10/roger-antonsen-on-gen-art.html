<p>I found <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/roger_antonsen_math_is_the_hidden_secret_to_understanding_the_world/">this TED talk</a> today, where <a href="http://rantonse.no/en">Roger Antonsen</a> says that, to understand something, you have to look at it from different perspectives. That sounds psychological or sociological, or even (especially lately) political, but it’s actually a math talk. To me, it described the process of making generative art, but from a very different perspective.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-and-language-to-describe-them">Patterns, and Language to Describe Them</h2>

<p>His “day-to-day definition of math” reminds me of the process I go through when working on a new gen-art piece, or exploring a programming abstraction. He says math is about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finding patterns: “a connection, a structure, some regularity, some rules that govern what we see.”</li>
  <li>Representing those patterns with a language. “We make up language if we don’t have it, and in mathematics, this is essential.”</li>
  <li>Making assumptions, and playing around with them to see what happens.</li>
  <li>“Doing cool stuff. Mathematics enables us to do so many things.”</li>
</ul>

<p>When I make a Processing sketch, I’m usually looking for interesting patterns or regularities that can be generated by algorithm. The algorithm becomes a langauge to describe and represent the patterns - not just one image, but the set of all images the algorithm can generate. Since I’m often making up the algorithm as I go, I’m making up that language. As I build and refine the algorithm, “playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens” is a how I look for more-interesting variants to the main idea.</p>

<h2 id="equations-as-metaphor">Equations as Metaphor</h2>

<p><img src="/images//2016/12/10/equation-2x.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An equation says that something is equal to something else. On the one hand,
it’s a sum; on the other hand, it’s a multiplication, and those are two
different perspectives.  And I would go as far as to say that every equation
is like this, every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign is
actually a metaphor. It’s an analogy between two things. You’re just viewing
something and taking two different points of view, and you’re expressing that
in a language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to look at the number 4/3 from several perspectives: in decimal (1.33333…), in binary (1.010101010…), in base 3 (1.1), as a 4x3 rectangle, as the sides of a 3-4-5 right triangle, as the aspect ratio of old computer screens and TVs, as generating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve">Lissajous curve</a>, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_intonation">just interval</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fourth">a perfect fourth</a>, and as producing a counter-point rhythm when every fourth 16th note is played, and every third 16th note is played on top of it.</p>

<p><img src="/images//2016/12/10/four-thirds-rhythm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This translation of an idea into a different form is also a good way to explore generative art. Often, I’ll explore an idea, and reach a plateau where it turns boring, and it only really gets interesting once I’ve put it into some different context.</p>

<p>Small surprise that <a href="https://twitter.com/rantonse/status/805213796654575616">his twitter feed is recently featuring work made with Processing</a>.</p>
